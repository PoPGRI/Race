A pop-up window should appear and ask you to select an existing key pair. We selected "Proceed without a key pair" to make things easy, but feel free to add your own key pair.

It should ask you for username and password. The username is "ubuntu" and the password should be the one you set in Step 2.

After logging into the machine, open a terminal, inside the home directory run ```./fixCarla.sh```. After it finishes, you should be able to use carla by running ```~/workspace/carla-simulator/CarlaUE4.sh```.

All files are installed in the "~/workspace" directory. Enjoy!
