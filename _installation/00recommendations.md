This page will guide you through the steps necessary to setup the software for participating in GRAIC. Before starting, here is the system we recommend you to use.

### System recommendation

GRAIC 2021 uses the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/), [ROS Noetic](https://www.ros.org/) and CARLA is built on the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). That is why you will want to run the simulator on a machine with a at least 16GB RAM and a powerful GPU.

#### Software
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Carla 0.9.11
- ROS Noetic
- Python 3.7
- Open GL 3.3 or above and DirectX 10

#### Hardware
- Intel i7 gen / i9 gen / AMD ryzen 7 / ryzen 9
- At least 16 GB RAM
- NVIDIA RTX 2070 / 2080 / 3070 / 3080 with 4GB GPU video ram

The instructions for CARLA installation can be found [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/). It is recommended to use the [CARLA Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/carlasim/carla). The instructions for ROS Noetic installation can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
