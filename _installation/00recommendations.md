PoPGRI uses the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/) alongside [ROS Noetic](https://www.ros.org/) to run synthesis algorithms. The CARLA simulator is built on the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). The instructions for CARLA installation can be found [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/). It is recommended to use the [CARLA Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/carlasim/carla). The instructions for ROS Noetic installation can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
