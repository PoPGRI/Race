We have provided a template controller for you to get started on creating your own controller.
This template can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/PoPGRI/Race) and it is called `src/race/src/starter.py`.
You will not have to edit any part of the file other than line 66. You should replace `TODO Add your decision logic here` with the decision logic of your controller.

To further understand how to create controllers, take a look at the interfaces described on our [docs](https://popgri.github.io/Race/documentation/) page.
