You can use the [baseline controller](https://github.com/PoPGRI/Race/blob/main/graic_core/src/baseline.py) as a template. In this file, only the `class Controller` is necessary. You can modify this class to implement your own controller. To further understand how to create controllers, take a look at the interfaces described on our [docs](https://popgri.github.io/Race/documentation/) page.
