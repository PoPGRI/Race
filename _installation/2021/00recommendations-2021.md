This page will guide you through the steps necessary to setup the software for participating in GRAIC. Before starting, here is the system we recommend you to use.

### System recommendation

GRAIC 2021 uses the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/), [ROS Noetic](https://www.ros.org/) and CARLA is built on the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). That is why you will want to run the simulator on a machine with a at least 16GB RAM and a powerful GPU.

#### Hardware
- Intel i7 gen / i9 gen / AMD ryzen 7 / ryzen 9, with at least 16 GB RAM
- Nvidia RTX 2070 / 2080 / 3070 / 3080 with 4GB GPU video RAM

#### Software
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Carla 0.9.11
- ROS Noetic
- Python 3.7
- Open GL 3.3 or above and DirectX 10

We will not be able to provide much support for running GRAIC on other software configurations.
