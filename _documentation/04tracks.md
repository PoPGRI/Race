We will provide several race environments prior to the competition for competitors to test their controllers on. These competition tracks contain other vehicles, pedestrians, and various static obstacles that the vehicles must avoid. We will also provide an evaluation script so the competitors have an idea of how their vehicle performed.
These race environments will be different than the ones provided during the competition. Additionally, the vehicles will be evaluated on tracks that the competitors will not have access to so that the generality of the decision and control modules can be tested.
