We are providing several test environments with tracks, other vehicles, pedestrians, and static obstacles that the vehicles must avoid. We are also providing a scoring function.
These test environments will be different than the ones used during the final race.

# Evaluation

*We are yet to finalize the scoring function!*

Roughly, the final will be calculated based on the average speed and completion time of the vehicle. There will be big penalties for hitting obstacles and running offtrack.
