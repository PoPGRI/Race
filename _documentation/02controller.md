The decision and control module is built by the competitors. Any pre-computations required must be provided by the competitors, and must run without additional effort from the competition hosts. The decision and control module must output the vehicle inputs required by the vehicle system (rostopics `ackermann_cmd` or `vehicle_control_cmd`).
