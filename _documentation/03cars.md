The final GRAIC race will be on several different vehicle models. We have provides several vehicle models with our initial release, but these vehicle models may changein the coming months. Competitors can participate in either the "model-free" or the "model-based" category.

### Model-free category
In the model-free category, vehicle physics is given by CARLA's vehicle simulator. These are either 4-wheeled or 2-wheeled vehicles. Some basic information about these vehicles will be provided (such as the wheelbase). All the vehicles use the rostopics `ackermann_control` or `vehicle_control`.


### Model-based category
In the model-based category, the vehicle will follow the dynamics detailed below. The exact parameter values for the model will be provided in the following weeks. The controller modules that competitors create will use the same `ackermann_control` or `vehicle_control` rostopics above.

#### Longitudinal dynamics

$$\dot{u} = a - f_1 u - f_2 u^{2} - f_3,$$

where $u$ is the forward velocity of the vehicle and \\(a\\) is the acceleration generated by the throttle input.

#### Lateral dynamics

$$\begin{bmatrix} \dot{v}\\ \dot{r}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
-(C_{\alpha f}+ C_{\alpha r})/(mu) & (bC_{\alpha r}-aC_{\alpha f})/(mu) - u\\
(bC_{\alpha r} - aC_{\alpha f})/(I_z u) & -(a^2 C_{\alpha f} + b^2 C_{\alpha r}/(I_z u))
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
v\\r
\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}
C_{\alpha f}/m \\ a C_{\alpha f}/I_{z}
\end{bmatrix}\delta_f$$

where \\(v\\) and \\(r\\) are the lateral velocity and the second order derivative of the vehicle's yaw angle, and \\(\delta_{f}\\) is the steering command.

\\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), \\(f_3\\), \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(C_{ \alpha r}\\), \\(C_{ \alpha r}\\), \\(I_{z}\\) and \\(m\\) are parameters corresponding to the vehicle. Please refer to the book "Automotive Control Systems" by A. Galip Ulsoy et al. for the physical interpretation of those parameters and the modeling details of the longitudinal and lateral dynamics.
