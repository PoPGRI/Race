Results table:

|                |Race 1|Race 2|Race 3|Race 4|Race 5|Race 6|
|:--------------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Basic Controller|128   |140   |137   |98    |404   |126   |
|Human Driver    |49    |57    |91    |53    |73    |49    |
|Winner          |61    |130   |132   |DNF   |115   |60    |

The scoring function is roughly: score = time to finish + collision penalty + out of bounds penalty. Therefore, the lower the score, the better the controller performance. A score of DNF means that the controller did not finish.
