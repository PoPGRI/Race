Come join us here: https://illinois.zoom.us/j/85606189745?pwd=ekR5T0JQMjlTTW56ZVBjeWRLQXFwUT09
Our zoom room will have people in it to answer your questions during normal EOH hours on Friday and Saturday.

In March 2021, we will run the Mini-GRAIC Race for [Engineering Open House at UIUC](https://eohillinois.org/)!
The Mini-GRAIC race is aimed at junior-high and high-school students to introduce them to the world of autonomy.
In the Mini-GRAIC race, students will tell us what car and controller they would like to use.
We will run the vehicle on our simulator and output a score.
The videos of the cars running will be posted to our YouTube channel and the leaderboard will be posted here.
