In March 2021, we ran the Mini-GRAIC Race for [Engineering Open House at UIUC](https://eohillinois.org/)!
The Mini-GRAIC race is aimed at junior-high and high-school students to introduce them to the world of autonomy.
In the Mini-GRAIC race, students told us what car and controller they wanted use.
We ran the vehicle on our simulator and output a score.
The videos of the cars running are posted to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wObn3tWYZDkWld-Kg8LRA) and the leaderboard is posted here.

Our EOH video can be found below.
