*Track information is subject to change*

There are two available tracks to compete in.

### Model-Free Track

In this track, the vehicle system provided by Carla is used. This vehicle system is very complicated and cannot be fully known. The synthesis algorithms used in this track must be able to compute inputs for the system even though the full dynamics of the system are unknown.

### Model Track
In this track, a vehicle model (such as the bicycle model) will be provided to the competitors. This model is simpler than the one provided by Carla. The synthesis algorithms in this track can take advantage of the fact that the full dynamics of the system are known.
