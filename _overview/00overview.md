The competition will provide an early release of the framework to allow the competitors to run tests. This early release will contain a baseline algorithm, test vehicle, and test environment. This test vehicle and test environment are not the same as the ones provided on the day of the competition.
On the day of the competition, a final release will be provided. This final release will contain the competition vehicle and the competition environment. The competitors will have 2 hrs after the final release for submissions. These submissions will then be run by the competition hosts for scoring.

#### Scoring
The synthesis algorithms will be scored based on many factors. These factors include:
- Safety: How well can the vehicle avoid obstacles?
- Time to completion: How quickly does the vehicle complete the track?
- Computation time: How long does it take to synthesize inputs?
