## Camp Leaderboard

<https://summer-camp-2022.herokuapp.com/>

"Code a Car" is a day camp that will take place at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Building](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/buildings/ecebuilding) 5072, and will give participants an exciting hands-on experience in creating the brains of an autonomous car. During the camp, learners will write code for lane detection, autopilot, planning, and run this code on simulated vehicles. On the last day, if all goes according to plan, students will have the opportunity to deploy their code on a real car!

Campers will:

* Learn about technology that is embedded in autonomous vehicles
* Use industry standard software to write code for lane detection, autopilot, planning, and run this code on simulated vehicles.
* Work collaboratively with other campers to solve problems
* Learn how to debug and fix code

Dates: The GRAIC team will be hosting a summer camp for highschool students at UIUC over August 1-5, 2022.

## Lab Visits

### Tuesday

*Human-Robot Fist Bump Human & Intention Tracking for Collaborative Assembly*

Demo by Ye-Ji Mun from Prof. Katie Driggs-Campbell’s Group

Illinois Robotics Lab

1. Human-Robot Fist Bump: The Kinova retrieves a human’s fist pose from its mounted camera and follows the human’s fist movement using visual servoing technique.
2. Human Intention Tracking for Collaborative Assembly: A human worker and a UR5e robot work together to assemble industrial connectors. After the human aligns the connector parts, the UR5e pushes the aligned connectors for their insertion.

### Wednesday

*RTAB-Map & Image Goal Navigation*

Demo by Justin Wasserman from Prof. Girish Chowdhary’s Group

ECEB 5072

Preview of Justin's demo:

## Organizer(s)

**Yan Miao** will be your camp coordinator. Yan is a 2nd-year grad student at Illinois under the advisement of Prof. Sayan Mitra. His primary research focuses on improving the safety of autonomous systems, mainly autonomous vehicles and drones. His recent work includes involves learning-based robotics and reinforcement learning in the area of self-driving cars.

**Raj Joshi** will be the assistant coordinator. Raj is a undergraduate student majoring in Statistics and Computer Science at Illinois. His was part of the [Generalized Racing Intelligence Competition](https://popgri.github.io/Race/), working on developing autonomous testing pipelines to evaluate autonomous vehicle controllers.

**[Sayan Mitra](https://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/)** had the brainwave of creating this camp. He is a Professor at Illinois and does  research on autonomous systems.
