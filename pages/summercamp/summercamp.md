The GRAIC team will be hosting a summer camp for highschool students at UIUC over August 1-5, 2022. The camp will give the participants an exciting hands-on experience in creating the brains of an autonomous car. You will write code for lane detection, autopilot, planning, and run this code on simulated and real autonomous cars. The camp will be located in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Building](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/buildings/ecebuilding).
