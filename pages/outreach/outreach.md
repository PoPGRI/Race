## CPS Week 2022 {#graic22}
GRAIC was hosted at [CPS-IOT Week 2022](https://cpsiotweek.neslab.it/).
Congratulations to our solo race winners SBU and our head-to-head race winners MERCI!

The video from our live event can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wObn3tWYZDkWld-Kg8LRA). The video can be found here: [https://youtu.be/mANCmMeI6_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJLkORUG11U).

## EOH 2022 {#eoh22}
In April 2022, we ran the first in person [Engineering Open House at UIUC](https://eohillinois.org/) version of GRAIC!
This event is aimed at junior-high and high-school students.
The exhibit consisted of three main parts:
  - **Controller creation and submission** - Students adjust various parameters of the baseline controller and submit to our testing pipeline. We then generate race logs and a video to show them how their controller behaved.
  -  **Manual racing against baseline autonomous agent** - Students could use our steering wheel setup to race against one of our autonomous agents. This gives them an idea of the differences between autonomous agent driving and human driving.
  - **GRAIC and autonomous vehicles presentation** - Any questions students had about autonomous driving or GRAIC could be answered at our presentation.

Videos and race logs from the submitted controllers can be found on our [leaderboard](https://graic-eoh-2022.herokuapp.com/).

This event was very successful, and our exhibit won three awards! We were awarded first place for *The Spirit of Innovation* and *Most Engaging* awards, and we were awarded second place of *Outstanding Tech*.
Here are some pictures from our very exciting event!

    <h1>GRAIC '21</h1>
    <p>GRAIC '21 was the first iteration of GRAIC hosted at CPS-IOT Week 2021.
    GRAIC '22 is based on this first iteration of GRAIC, and we hope to improve the quality of GRAIC.
    GRAIC '21 was a part of three events: the OCAR-ICRA 2021 workshop, CPS-IOT Week 2021, and EOH 2021 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
    A brief description of these events and their associated videos can be found below.</p>

## OCAR-ICRA 2021   {#ocar-icra21}

GRAIC was presented at [OCAR-ICRA](https://linklab-uva.github.io/icra-autonomous-racing/) workshop.
The workshop paper can be found [here](https://linklab-uva.github.io/icra-autonomous-racing/contributed_papers/paper13.pdf).
The video presentation for GRAIC can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zsJtb6kaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zsJtb6kaY), and our presentation starts at 1:02:30.

## CPS Week 2021   {#cps-week21}

GRAIC was hosted at [CPS-IOT Week 2021](https://cps-iot-week2021.isis.vanderbilt.edu/).
Congratulations to our winners [Abolfazl Karimi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abolfazl-karimi-175a153a/) and [Parasara Sridar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/) (UNC)!

We will be hosting a live event at CPS-IOT Week! At this event, we will present on the GRAIC framework and host a Q&A. We will then discuss the competition and present the results. Finally, we will have a community discussion and talk about future plans for GRAIC. A program can be found below.

The video from our live event can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wObn3tWYZDkWld-Kg8LRA). The video can be found here: [https://youtu.be/mANCmMeI6_0](https://youtu.be/mANCmMeI6_0).

The passcode is 994234. -->

### Program
Our presentation will be held Tuesday, May 18. All times are central time.
- 9-9:45: The generalized racing framework: GRAIC team
- 9:45-10: Q&A, discussion
- 10-10:30: GRAIC 2021 experience, stats, and results
- 10:30-11: Community discussion and planning

### Results
Congratulations to our winners [Abolfazl Karimi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abolfazl-karimi-175a153a/) and [Parasara Sridar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/) (UNC)!

Results table:



|                |Race 1|Race 2|Race 3|Race 4|Race 5|Race 6|
|:--------------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Basic Controller|128   |140   |137   |98    |404   |126   |
|Human Driver    |49    |57    |91    |53    |73    |49    |
|Winner          |61    |130   |132   |DNF   |115   |60    |


The scoring function is roughly: score = time to finish + collision penalty + out of bounds penalty. Therefore, the lower the score, the better the controller performance. A score of DNF means that the controller did not finish.


## EOH 2021 {#eoh21}
In March 2021, we ran the Mini-GRAIC Race for [Engineering Open House at UIUC](https://eohillinois.org/)!
The Mini-GRAIC race is aimed at junior-high and high-school students to introduce them to the world of autonomy.
In the Mini-GRAIC race, students told us what car and controller they wanted use.
We ran the vehicle on our simulator and output a score.
The videos of the cars running are posted to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wObn3tWYZDkWld-Kg8LRA) and the leaderboard is posted here.

Our EOH video can be found below.
